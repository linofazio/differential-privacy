    "In this dataset, how many people can we re-identify uniquely? We can use our auxiliary information to find out! First, let's see what happens with just dates of birth. We want to know how many *possible identities* are returned for each data record in the dataset. The following histogram shows the number of records with each number of possible identities. The results show that we can uniquely identify almost 7,000 of the data records (out of about 32,000), and an additional 10,000 data records are narrowed down to two possible identities."

    "When we use both pieces of information, we can re-identify **essentially everyone**. This is a surprising result, since we generally assume that many people share the same birthday, and many people live in the same ZIP code. It turns out that the *combination* of these factors is **extremely** selective. According to Latanya Sweeney's work {cite}`identifiability`, 87% of people in the US can be uniquely re-identified by the combination of date of birth, gender, and ZIP code."

    "### On Malicious Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "A recurring theme in privacy-preserving data analysis is that **distinguishing between malicious and non-malicious queries is not possible**. This limitation is especially important in the context of de-identified or aggregated data, where we might be tempted to assume that certain queries are “safe” simply because they appear innocuous on the surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that an attacker doesn't need to issue obviously suspicious queries to violate privacy. Often, the danger lies in combinations of seemingly benign queries whose results can be synthesized to extract sensitive information. For example, asking for the sum of all ages in a dataset and then asking for the sum with a single individual removed can allow an attacker to learn that individual’s exact age via differencing—even though neither query, by itself, looks malicious.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the system's point of view, there is no inherent difference between a privacy-respecting query and an attack. The queries themselves are just instructions for computation. Their intent is not part of the query syntax, and there is no reliable way to detect whether a query is part of a larger strategy to extract sensitive information. In fact, even if we were to limit access to queries that were pre-approved or whitelisted, this wouldn't prevent clever users from chaining together allowable queries to infer private values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This *indistinguishability* is part of why ad hoc approaches to privacy, like de-identification or aggregation alone, tend to fail. They rely on implicit assumptions about how the data will be used and who is asking the questions. But in practice, we cannot guarantee those assumptions hold, especially once data is released or exposed to external users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differential privacy was designed to address exactly this challenge. It provides formal guarantees that hold regardless of what queries are asked or what auxiliary information the adversary possesses. Under differential privacy, **all queries—malicious or not—are treated uniformly**, and privacy is maintained by controlling the output distributions themselves, not by attempting to guess the user’s intent.\n"
